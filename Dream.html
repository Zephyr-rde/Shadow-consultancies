            <h1>Rôse: A Dream of Eternal Devotion</h1>
            <p class="author">By Rây</p>
        </div>

        <p class="intro">"This was my dream—a tale of Rôse, the love I can't find in waking life."</p>

        <h2>Prologue</h2>
        <p>"You were new to the city and its unfamiliar faces, staying for just a week while your father, a partner at
            my boss's investment firm, handled business. I was handed a company card with one task: to make you feel
            comfortable and happy, to show you a world you'd never seen."</p>

        <p>I tried to just play around and let go as it would be fun for both of us, but you who were so passionate, one
            of a kind, and naive to most things were so excited to be around me.</p>

        <h2>Day 1: A Hesitant Dawn</h2>
        <p>The first day, I didn't make any moves and was not even interested, which you didn't like.</p>

        <h2>Day 2: A Whisper of Understanding</h2>
        <p>The next day was also the same, but I tried to contact you and we talked for a few minutes, and I got to know
            what kind of person you were, the things you like, dislike, and enjoy.</p>

        <div class="rose-divider">✿ ❦ ✿</div>

        <h2>Day 3: The Flame Awakens</h2>
        <p>The third day, this is where our journey really starts. I took you to some of the best places I love, and I
            started seeing you for the person you were. You made me feel special and you were starting to notice me and
            understand me. We have had some huge developments, being past the acquaintance stage, developing a close
            friendship bond… and that night I spent it with you, observing you so closely.</p>

        <p class="dialogue">"When you grinned at me that night, your smile glowed so brightly that my chest tightened—I
            knew I had to shield it forever."</p>

        <p>I got this feeling that I should protect your <span class="highlight">SMILE</span> from the bottom of my
            heart.</p>

        <h2>Day 4: Love Forged in Adversity</h2>
        <p>The fourth day, we had some bad encounters, and I, as I pledged to protect you, saved us from all those
            instances, and I don't know where you got connected to me. We developed feelings for each other, and as I am
            possessive of the people I love, I would show my intimacy in a very real manner, which you would like the
            most. Holding you tight for so long that both of us didn't even notice the time, and we would hold hands
            tightly and express our deep feelings through just our eyes and slowly we began leaning towards each other
            along side the witnesses of Nature - we had our first kiss in my car— in a plain forest type where The trees
            loomed dark against the moonlit starry sky. We would not let go of ourselves, even if we wanted to. I hoped
            that time would stop for just the moment / just for us.</p>

        <p>Then at midnight, we would go to your home. I would talk to your father, and he eyed me warily as if
            disgusted seeing me beside you, well not that I cared much about it because at the end of the day all that
            mattered to me was you, and there was another friend of mine, whom you didn't like as she was also trying to
            be intimate with me. So you thought to take this a step further, and we went inside your room. You went
            inside the washroom, and I would sit in your bed. I loved your room, bedsheets so much, as they constantly
            had your fragrance on them, and I could smell it. After a few minutes, you came out of the washroom, with
            just a white towel covering your body. I saw the look in your eyes, which were crying for me to hold you and
            never let go. That moment I decided— that you are the love of my life, and I would go to any lengths just
            for you… I would hold you so tight with you in the towel, and we both hugged each other. And lay on your
            bed, and slept so good. [Nothing major happened.] All night we were holding onto each other as if we had
            found what we wanted for the rest of our lives. That was one of the best days of my life— and the reason is
            I found you.</p>

        <div class="rose-divider">✿ ❦ ✿</div>

        <h2>Day 5: Passion's Triumph</h2>
        <p>The Fifth day was very good. We were both happy that we progressed so much from our initial start, and I take
            you to one of my favorite hotels in the city, the top floor with a swimming pool on that. That day was also
            special for us. We were all by ourselves in the hotel and we found just the right place to progress. I
            stepped onto the pool, where you followed it, and you with your breathtaking eyes, and amazing expressions
            were looking at me so intimately, as if to congratulate our progression - we were having the best time in
            there. I slowly started approaching you, sliding my hands through your waist and neck, giving you a hickey.
            With all my heart, we started kissing right after that. And that was the start of one of best moments of
            both our lives. We progressed into a much further intimacy in nature and made some moves as an adult, as a
            tribute to our love and the result of our relationship. Both of us had an unforgettable time, and each and
            every thing we do makes our love stronger and stronger, more so than ever.</p>

        <h2>Day 6: A Vision of Forever</h2>
        <p>The Sixth day—though I wanted to spend all day with you— and I had decided to let go of everything for you—
            and come wherever you were— I wanted to marry you and spend the rest of my life with you, where I will be
            yours and you will solely be mine. I had made up my mind— and I was marveling at our miracle, that the love
            we had was the result of many coincidences which is nothing short of a miracle. I was going to introduce you
            to my parents— and was ready to tell goodbye to each and everyone I knew of, just to live with you.</p>

        <h2>The Last Day: A Soul Torn Asunder</h2>
        <p>The last day - when I was sorting out everything - I tried to contact you, and I couldn't. After 4 hours of
            trying to reach you - I got a call from you. She, my love, had a cold tone to her beautiful warm voice. She
            was trying to have some distance from me - and I was on the verge of breaking.</p>

        <p class="dialogue">"Rôse, I know we didn't have the best start - of all things - but we had the best moments in
            our life. You are not someone I would want to be with to gain anything - not your beauty - money or status.
            Speaking to you in this manner and hearing you speak in that tone is making my heart beat so fast - making
            me anxious for the first time in my life - and it is very hard to speak in this manner. You know I still
            remember you texted for me on the third day - saying you love me so much but didn't want to tell it on text
            but in person to me and make it so memorable for us - and now hearing what you're about to tell is going to
            break my heart."</p>

        <p>After listening to this, I heard her voice break. She was crying but trying to hold back, as if she is in a
            situation where she thinks that I would be in danger - if I was with her - but I honestly don't care about
            all that. I don't care if I die. If I get to spend my last breath with you beside me, that would make my
            soul so happy and that is all I care for.</p>

        <div class="rose-divider">✿ ❦ ✿</div>

        <p>The last day - Rôse's father threatened her, saying he would make my life hell would kill all my parents,
  all my           and close ones, and ultimately kill me too - My Rôse, she was so helpless, she didn't want to hurt me even
            if she was faced with death | the only person I love in this world - proved to me that she loved me more
            than me - But OH My love - if we are not allowed to live in this world - let's love each other in Heaven -
            and even in Heaven,if someone tries to separate us, then Fuck Heaven and Live in HELL - I would want to be
            with you even after my death - Our love is eternal - which even we don't have the right to discard - it is
            so sacred and worthy of worship - This is ultimately my fault, I couldn't even take care of the only person
            I love in the world, I am so useless and weak - what use is the current me, except a burden for both of us -
            BUT Wait for me, MY Love - I would burn this world - if I heard a drop of tears from those mesmerizing eyes
            - I will not fear even if the whole world is opposing us, I would fight until my last breath to see you
            again - and wouldn't hesitate to spend my last breath for you, SO please wait for me.</p>

        <h2>Epilogue</h2>
        <p class="last-paragraph">"I woke up searching for you, Rôse, wondering if somewhere, somehow, you're waiting
            for me too."
